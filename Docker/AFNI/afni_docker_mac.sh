# .SYNOPSIS
# Launches AFNI within a Docker container.

# .DESCRIPTION
# You need to manually launch docker before running this script. If you want a GUI,
# you also need to launch X Quartz. The GUI is disabled by default. See README for more info.
# Contact me via email or Slack if you need help. I'm here whenever you need me ðŸ™‚
