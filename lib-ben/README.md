[dataset-bopscanner](dataset-bopscanner) contains all the scripts I used to process Kiersten Riels's dataset.

[dataset-contrascan](dataset-contrascan) contains all the scripts I used to process Wendel Friedl's dataset.

[dataset-leipzig](dataset-leipzig) contains all the scripts I used to process Maeve Boylan's dataset.

Each of these projects is almost entirely self-contained. You can replicate anything I've created from these datasets if you use the tools in their respective folders and my script to launch fMRIPrep, which is located in [other](other).

[docker](docker) contains scripts that are very convenient to me when I fiddle with Docker containers. But I'm unsure whether we'll ever use Docker again at CSEA. It's really cool, but it's also hard to use.

Contact me with any questions about any of this.
