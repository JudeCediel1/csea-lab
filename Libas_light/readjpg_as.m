function [X,junk] = readjpg_as(filepath)%READBMP Read image data from a BMP file.%   [X,MAP] = READBMP(INFO) reads image data from a BMP file.%   INFO is the structure returned by IMFINFO(FILENAME, 'bmp').%   X is a uint8 array that is 2-D for 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit%   image data.  X is M-by-N-by-3 for 24-bit image data.  MAP is%   normally an M-by-3 MATLAB colormap, but it may be empty if%   the BMP file does not contain a colormap.%%   See also IMREAD, IMWRITE, IMFINFO, IMFORMATS.%   Steven L.
