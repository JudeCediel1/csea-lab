TODO: Update this README because this directory is pretty messy.

[docker](docker) contains scripts that are convenient to me when I fiddle with Docker containers. But I'm unsure whether we'll ever use Docker again at CSEA. It's really cool, but it's also hard to use.

Contact me with any questions about any of this.
